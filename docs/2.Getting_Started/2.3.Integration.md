# Integration

Once you already configurated the Stitch with config(), you need to then bootstrap the Stitch with start(). There are complicated processes inside the start journey that will initialize all the core components(i.e. appManager, serviceManager) and finally boot the Stitch up. The start method is an asynchronous procedure that will return a promise for subsequent operation. You can then append some subsequent logic with then() once the Stitch bootstrap is done.

```javascript
import stitch, { RouterAdaptor} from '@stitch/core';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';
import getStitchConfig from './utils';

// retrieve the stitch config for your main application
const config = getStitchConfig(); 
const history = createBrowserHistory();

// pass the config object as a mandatory parameter as well as other optional objects
stitch.config({
  config,
  router: new RouterAdaptor(history) 
});

// Stitch as the provider needs to be bootstrapped before being used
stitch.start().then((stitchInstance) => {
  // Add some subsequent logic using stitchInstance
});
```

Once you boot up the Stitch, in subsequent code logic you may use either API interface or React component interface to integrate the MFA with a particular router path. 

## Using API Interface
The Stitch exposes some simple APIs as interfaces so that its consumer can use them to load/unload specific remote applications in a standard MFE manner regardless of a particular js technical stack. 

```javascript
import { renderApp } from '@stitch/core';
// ...
if (matchMFARouter(path)) {
  const appName = getAppName(path);
  const remoteAppRoot = getRemoteAppRoot();
  //the first param is the dom for mfe app to mount itself on
  //the second param is the mfe app name
  renderApp(remoteAppRoot, appName);
}
```

## Using React component
The Stitch also exposes one simple react component as an interface so that any consumer relying on React technical stack can easily mount it to a router.  
```javascript
import AppHost from '@stitch/react';
// ...
const HOCHost = (props) => {
  return AppHost({ appName: _get(props, 'match.params.appName', ''), ...props });
};

<Route
   key={uuidv5(('hsbc-mfe-host').toString(), ROUTE_KEY_NAMESPACE)}
   path="/mfe/:appName"
   component={HOCHost}
/>
```
