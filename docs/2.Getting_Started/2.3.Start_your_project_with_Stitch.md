# Start your project with Stitch

The Stitch framework needs to be configured before use. Stitch config is mandatory to be passed into the Stitch for initialization. Because different main applications may have different implementations of defining their Stitch config and the ways of retrieving the config resource file, Stitch doesn't manage the way how the main application is going to retrieve the file, instead, Stitch standardises the config format with a predefined schema. See below a sample of HSBCnet implementation of Stitch config, for detailed schema please refer to the [Config Schema](https://alm-github.systems.uk.hsbc/Net-UI/stitch/blob/HEAD/docs/3.Config_Schema.md) chapter.

```json
{
  "org": {
    "product": "New UI"
  },
  "env": "Prod",
  "routerPath": "mfe",
  "hosts": [
    {
      "name": "CDN_Prod",
      "server": "cdn.hsbcnet.com",
      "publicPath": "/uims/cdn/2020504/static-dl/public/echannel/features/mfe"
    }
  ],
  "libs": [
    {
      "name": "payerManagement",
      "hostName": "CDN_Prod",
      "resource": "/pm/v20_1_2/remoteEntry.js",
      "apps": [
        {
          "name": "pending-inward-payments-summary",
          "routerName": ["pending-inward-payments"]
        },
        {
          "name": "payer-management-summary",
          "routerName": ["global-money-account-payers"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Once the Stitch config is retrieved, you may store it in a way of an object in memory by any means(i.e. if you are using redux, you may store it in Store). Then you need to pass this object as the parameter of calling the config() of the Stitch. In the meanwhile, you can also pass a few optional objects which are available for enhancing the Stitch (refer to each service introduction for the optional objects).

```javascript
import stitch from '@stitch/core';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

// retrieve the stitch config for your main application
const config = {}; // the config created above 
const history = createBrowserHistory();

// pass the config object as a mandatory parameter as well as other optional objects
stitch.config(config, { history });
```

Once you already configured the Stitch with config(), you need to then bootstrap the Stitch with start(). There are complicated processes inside the start journey that will initialize all the core components(i.e. appManager, serviceManager) and finally boot the Stitch up. The start method is an asynchronous procedure that will return a promise for subsequent operation. You can then append some subsequent logic with then() once the Stitch bootstrap is done.

```javascript
// Stitch as the provider needs to be bootstrapped before being used
stitch.start().then((stitchInstance) => {
  // Add some subsequent logic using stitchInstance
});
```

Once you boot up the Stitch, in subsequent code logic you may use either API interface or React component interface to integrate the MFA with a particular router path. 

## Using React component

The Stitch also exposes one simple react component as an interface so that any consumer relying on React technical stack can easily mount it into your application slot.  

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import AppHost from '@stitch/react';

const YourApp = () => {
  return <AppHost appName="pending-inward-payments-summary" />;
}

ReactDOM.render(<YourApp />, dom);
```
