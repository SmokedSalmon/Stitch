# MFA Deployment

Before deploying your MFA, there are some key points you need to consider:

1. How to avoid to hit browser cache after deployment?
2. How to rollback to last success version if needed?

To answer these questions here, we are going to show you a real world example about how we deploy a MFA In HSBCNET in below sections.

- Overall design for MFA Resource/Stitch Config

- MFA Resource upload

- Stitch Config update

## Overall design

We will generate a Stitch config in our server, and the ideal structure should be like that:

We notice the high light of the path, we got Suffix and Prefix here,

- The prefix can provide us a better version control
- The suffix of the path is aimed at avoiding server/browser cache correspondingly

In this design, We can change our prefix and suffix based on our different scenarios(such as version upgrade or back out), Once we Config effect,  it will update according to the config immediately.

## MFA Resource upload

Each channel has its own way to put its resource to the server, In HSBCNET, we will follow below steps to do that:

1. Build our package
2. Upload it into Nexus and G3(Uploading static resources to server, and get public url for remoteEntry.js)

But it doesn't have to be this way,  you still can achieve that in your own method to do that.

## Update Config

Once we deploy our Resource successfully, which means the MFA Resource is ready to use, we will update our resource as below example:

```js
// this is an Stitch config file
 {
      "name": "payerManagement",
      "hostName": "SDE3",
-     "resource": "/pm/v_hd202/remoteEntry.js",
+     "resource": "/pm/v_hd2021/remoteEntry.js",
      ...
 }
```

We will deploy Config after that

Please node that Stitch will work on the same way for the same Config no matter where it came from.

## Production support

Stitch doesn't distinguish Prod/Dev in most of the processing except for logging.

In this case, we have excellent development experience because we can use production resource with local Host debug and vice versa.

With this extension of ability, if we need to back out or FF, we can make it happen just with three-step:

1. Get ready your resource, Deploy it
2. Change your Stitch Config resource
3. Upload Stitch Config
