# Webpack Config

Webpack building system is what we expected for each of MFAs you created.

Here we are going to highlight some Key configurations we required you to follow.

## Entry point

In Webpack default config, an Entry is needed as building entry, but in Stitch, we require the entry to follow ModuleFederation's pattern in the config, one more thing, exposes name **"RemoteEntry"** is a mandatory name here, we must use this naming here.

Example:

```js
// this is the main entry we need you to config
const moduleFederationPlugin = new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: "yourApp", 
  library: { type: "var", name: "yourApp" }, // the name of this MFELib, match the "name" of "libs" item of Stitch config
  filename: "remoteEntry.js",
  exposes: {
    // "RemoteEntry" is the fixed name exposes, will used by Stitch
    "RemoteEntry": './src/MFELib',
  }
});
```

## Loader

In most of our use cases, using the same Webpack config is acceptable.Â  so all the loaders, Plugins you put it in should work at the same expectation.

Example:

```js
// we can add our loader base on what we need here
const rules = [
  {
    test: /\.css$/,
    use: [
      "style-loader",
      {
        loader: "css-loader",
        options: {
          importLoaders: 1,
          sourceMap: true,
        },
      },
      "postcss-loader",
    ],
  },
  {
    test: /\.less$/,
    use: [
      {
        loader: "style-loader",
      },
      {
        loader: "css-loader",
        options: {
          sourceMap: true,
        },
      },
      {
        loader: "less-loader",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,
    exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
    use: {
      loader: "babel-loader",
      options: {
        presets: ["@babel/preset-react"],
      },
    },
  },
];
```

## Resource

What you build in by the Webpack, will output in a particular folder you pointing to. They will be all managed by the entry.js

Example:

```js
// same thing as webpack config type
output: {
  filename: "[name]_[chunkhash].js",
},
```

## Production

Please note that we can do the same optimization in Webpack Config.

Example:

```js
const config = require("./webpack.config.js");

// webpack will compress all the files in production mode
module.exports = {
  ...config,
  mode: "production",
}
```
