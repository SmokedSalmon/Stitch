# Library Service
Library Service is designed to cater features/tools that satisfy:
* **Business-oriented** services that are specialized to serve a dedicated business goal. 
* Services **Closely tied** on a the same domain knowledge of certain MFAs that these services are owned & maintained by the same MFA
* Other applications **can benefit to re-use** such services, and they are happy to see that team export such tools across applications.

Given above scenario, **Stitch** provides **Library Service** API to enable MFA teams to ship their services remotely, within the same Library bundle/package.  
The Asynchronous loading process is accommodated into Stitch's Service mechanism in a way that **Library Services** are used same as other types of services.
