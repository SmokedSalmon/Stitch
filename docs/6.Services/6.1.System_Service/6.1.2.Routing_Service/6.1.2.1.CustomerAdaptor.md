# CustomerAdaptor

Router is a build-in instance in Stitch, but it has no build-in implementation.

Stitch provided an build-in adaptor (class [RouterAdaptor](https://alm-github.systems.uk.hsbc/Net-UI/stitch/blob/HEAD/docs/2.Getting_Started/2.4.Routing/2.4.1.RouterAdaptor.md)) base on [the history package](https://github.com/remix-run/history) (**v5**) implementation for different MFE App.

Each MFE App should works on the Router instance of the RouterAdaptor, for compatibility of different Stitch Host Application.

However, If host is not a History base SPA, and you might need to custom your RouterService by your own.

In this chapter, You will learn how to create a customer adapter.

## Interface

## Example

Basic the below function, to implement it one by one.

```js
class CustomerAdaptor extends RouterAdaptor {

  constructor () {
    // enable the advance function such lick navPrompt
    super();
  }

  get action () {
  }

  get location () {
  }

  push (to, state) {
  }

  replace (to, state) {
  }

  go (n) {
  }

  back () {
  }

  forward () {
  }

  block () {
  }

  listen () {
  }
}
```
