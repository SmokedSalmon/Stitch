# Navigation Prompt (NavPrompt)

**Used to prompt the user before navigating away from a page. When your application enters a state that should prevent the user from navigating away (like a form is half-filled out), use this tool.**

> Legacy name: Exit Service

## Quick Start Guide

### Add Navigation Prompt to your MFE application

**NavPrompt** is a **global singleton instance - navPrompt** is injected to every MFE application's **hostContext** by Stitch, it is under hostContext.router, you can access it as follows during your MFE initiation phase.

> In your MFE application's export definition, usually 'App.js'

```javascript
init(hostContext) {
    this.hostContext = hostContext;
    ...
    const { navPrompt } = hostContext.router
    this.unblock = navPrompt.block({ test: hostContext.hostPath })    // starts navigation blocking with user prompt
    ...
}
...
unmount() {
   ...
   this.unblock()    // stop navigation blocking
   ...
}
```

> :warning:**Attention: Stop it when necessary**
> NavPrompt's 'start()' method returns an **unblocked handler** as mean to stop it when necessary.  
>  Make sure you execute it at the end of your MFE application's life cycle, such as **unmount()** - to terminate NavPrompt's effect. Otherwise NavPrompt will continue to work outside your application.
> Alternatively, you can also call the NavPrompt instance's own '**stop()**' method.  
> With default options and no customized UI, **navPrompt** will now intercept any URL change that is leaving the MFE application's **hostPath**, ask user's confirmation with browser's default confirm prompt:

### Add customized UI to replace browser's default confirm prompt:

1. Construct your own popup dialog component, with:  
   at least 2 buttons - Cancel/Confirm button for user to cancel or confirm the leaving action.  
   handlers to show/hide the dialog component
2. Cancel button implements navPrompt's onCancel method  
   Confirm button implements navPrompt's onConfirm method
3. pass this dialog component, show/hide dialog handlers to navPrompt via its useCustomizedUI interface  
    Put this dialog component into your main application's layout, usually the same level as the your main application's router layer  
   Here's an example:
   > In the outmost layer of your main application, usually your layout/router definition file

```javascript
import { navPrompt } from 'net-ui-core'

let showNavPromptDialog;  // to pass the show/hide dialog handler

// Example of a simple popup dialog to ask whether use should cancel or confirm leaving current page
const NavPromptDialog = () => {
  const [isOpen, setOpen] = React.useState(false);
  showNavPromptDialog= setOpen;

  // The cancel/confirm button should implement Nav Prompt's onCancel/onConfirm method
  onCancleHandler = (e) => {
    setOpen(false);
    navPrompt.onCancel(e);
  }
  onConfirmHandler = (e) => {
    setOpen(false);
    navPrompt.onConfirm(e);
  }

  return (
      <Modal
        open={isOpen}
        onHide={() => setOpen(false)}
        closeIcon
        onClickCloseIcon={() => setOpen(false)}
        activeFocusTrap
      >
        <ModalHead display="flex">
          <Icon name="StatusWarningLight" mr="10px" />
          Are you sure to continue?
        </ModalHead>
        <ModalContent>
          <Typography>You will lose information entered so far by leaving the page</Typography>
        </ModalContent>
        <ModalFooter display="flex" justifyContent="space-between">

          <Button variant="light.tertiary" onClick={onCancleHandler}>Cancel</Button>
          <Button onClick={onConfirmHandler}>Confirm</Button>
        </ModalFooter>
      </Modal>
  );
};

// tell NavPrompt that you are using customized UI, also passing the show/hide handlers to let NavPrompt control the visibility of the customized Prompt Component
navPrompt.useCustomizedUI({
  show: () => { showNavPromptDialog(true); },
  hide: () => { showNavPromptDialog(false); }
});

...

// Example to integrate your popup dialog into a main application under React framework
React.render((
    <Provider store={stores}>
        <Router history={history}>
            <Layout childRoutes={...}>
                (... your main application layout)
            </Layout>
        </Router>
        // integrate the Customized UI here
        <NavPromptDialog />
    </Provider>
))
```

This simple popup dialog looks like:

### Make NavPrompt to be in-effect only when the page is unsaved ("dirty" mechanism)

By default, NavPrompt's dialog shows up regardless of user interacted with the page or not. If you want it to prompt only after certain user interaction (Such as unsaved content or un-submitted form), the **interceptUntouched** property is for the purpose.  
Configure the navPrompt's** interceptUntouched** property to **false**

> In your MFE application's export definition, usually 'App.js'

```javascript
init(hostContext) {
    this.hostContext = hostContext;
    ...
    this.unblock = navPrompt.block({ interceptUntouched: false })
    ...
```

Then navPrompt will NOT block page leave action when the page is NOT considered **dirty**. This status is kept internally by navPrompt.  
If you want to inform navPrompt that the page content is changed and want it begins to function, simply invoke:

> exitService here is the same object you access from hostContext

```javascript
init(hostContext) {
navPrompt.setDirty()
```

Clear the dirty status by calling **navPrompt.clearDirty()**
